					Aside from that obvious tid-bit, design engineers are primarily UI/UX designers and developers.
					Some are not only page designers but
					page/component builders as well. They create style guides, UI graphics and images, SEO maps,
					clickable
					prototypes, CSS [or SASS] rules, and reusable js/jquery snippets (modules). They
					also
					create page-level objects and components and make web pages responsive for a legion
					of modern devices and work with UI frameworks like Bootstrap, Materialize, and
					Foundation. UI/UX developers are primarily concerned with the "look and feel" of an
					application and work within the DOM to style a page according to spec. UI/UX devs
					are concerned with the visual aspects of a page such as padding, font sizes, image
					responsiveness, and content flow and positioning.</p>
